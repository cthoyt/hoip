# Homeostasis imbalance process ontology (HOIP)

Homeostasis imbalance process ontology (HoIP) is an ontology that systematizes a wide variety of terms involving homeostasis imbalance courses and processes.
The first version of HoIP focuses on homeostasis imbalance triggered by virus actions concerning COVID-19 infectious processes.
The HoIP contains an is-a hierarchy organized into three layers: the top layer contains general terms, mostly derived from the Basic Formal Ontology. The intermediate layer contains biomedical terms, and the lower layer contains homeostasis imbalance dependent terms.
